Generally, I like to look back over the past year's goals and reflect on what I've done to achieve those goals.  For some reason, I didn't make any goals (i.e., resolutions) at the beginning of 2012.  Maybe that's why I feel that I've been a bit off course this year.

Things don't always turn out like I planned, but it's always fun to look over the year's goals to see the direction my life took during the previous 365 days.  I hate that I'm missing out on that bit of excitement this year.

While many of my peers are currently passed out in a ditch or smoking their brains out (okay, some of them are really at home with the kids), I decided I wanted to spend some time in quiet reflection this New Year's Eve.  Partly, this is because I've been a little sick from all the crazy weather and unhealthy food over the past week.  However, I also want to start setting out some concrete plans for 2013.

Rather than big, lofty goals, I'm mostly going with specific, achievable goals.  So, here's looking forward to 2013.

<h2>Health and fitness goals</h2>

<h3>New diet</h3>

This is already a crazy debate between me and my friends/family, but I've decided to go on completely vegan diet.  You won't see a photo of me in a spinach mankini or anything of the sort posted on my blog.  I'm just trying the food.  But, folks want to know <em>why</em> I'm taking this direction.  

It's simple.

I like to try new diets to see how they affect my health.  Plus, I get to try out all kinds of new foods or combinations of foods.

I've tried both Eating-for-Life (Body-for-Lie) and Paleo/Primal over the last couple of years.  I haven't been completely satisfied with either.  They're both better than eating processed junk food, but there have been too many drawbacks for me with both.

So, I &mdash; lover of all things bacon and dairy &mdash; will be going vegan.  Actually, I've been 95% switched over during the past month and am enjoying the extra energy I have.

I'll see this diet through.  If it works for me, I'll stick with it.  If not, I'll try something new.  I'm sure I'll be posting about this in the future.

<h3>High Blood Pressure</h3>

One thing I've yet to be able to manage with any of my diets is high blood pressure.  Most people in my family have problems with this, but I don't want to take pills for the rest of my life to manage it.  Granted, it has gotten better over the last couple of years with a change in diet and plenty of weight loss.  But, it's not where it should be.

My stepmother and stepsister (both <abbr title="Registered Nurse">RN</abbr>s) are pushing me to get on medication now.  Therefore, I've got this year to fix the issue dietarily or give in to their demands.

<h3>Weight/fat loss</h3>

About a year ago, I saw the first possibility that I might have visible abs at some point in the future.  But, after 12 months of Paleo/Primal eating, I found myself at a higher weight than what I'd started.  I've managed to get that back under control down to roughly 225 lbs.

This year, I hope to slowly and healthfully get under 205 lbs.  This is more of a goal for mid-year.  I'll be reevaluating this then.

<h3>Pushups</h3>

Earlier this year, I switched from weights to calithesthenics for my strength training.  This has been a bit of a struggle trying to find a good balance between endurance and strength.  So, I've set my sights on a new pushup goal:  to do at least a single one-arm pushup with perfect form.

I've got a long road ahead of me on this one, but I'm getting closer.  I'm currently progressing through uneven pushups.

<h3>Running</h3>

After trying my hand at running 5<abbr title="Kilometer">K</abbr>s, I've decided it's not really my style.  I'm just not built for those type of runs.  Now, I'm training more for shorter distances.  With that in mind, I have a goal to run a 6-minute mile this year.

I probably won't give up on longer runs entirely, but I'm going to shift my focus for now.

<h2>WordPress goals</h2>

This is why you're <em>really</em> reading this post, right?  I've always got plans for doing cool stuff with WordPress, and these goals are constantly changing or being refined.  But, I've got some things I want to see through over the next quarter to half year.

<h3>Hybrid Core</h3>

In 2012, Hybrid Core became a much more robust framework for theme development.  It's great seeing it being used for theme development in places like <a href="http://devpress.com" title="DevPress">DevPress</a>, <a href="http://alienwp.com" title="AlienWP">AlienWP</a>, and other places.
