Well, today has come and gone by just like any other for the most part.  However, I've been quietly contemplating the past 10 years of being involved in the WordPress community.  It's been a long, wacky, and exhilarating ride, one that I wouldn't change for anything in the world.

Here's a look at some fun firsts over the past 10 years:

* [Support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sidebar-on-a-separate-page) (Yes, I was once a regular user with the world's largest problems.)
* [Theme release](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/dark-sunflower-theme-release) (This was back before we had the cool theme directory.)
* [Plugin release](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cleaner-gallery/) (Not my first plugin but first that was built and put in the plugin repo.)
* [Core ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9851)
* [Core patch](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12158)
* [Attempt at a theme review](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/840)
* [Make Themes post](http://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/11/11/how-do-we-solve-the-theme-options-problem/)

By the way, this isn't my 10-year-WordPress anniversary.  That was actually 10 years and 10 days ago when I wrote my first WordPress-powered [blog post](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2005/05/13/still-finding-style).  That changed everything.
