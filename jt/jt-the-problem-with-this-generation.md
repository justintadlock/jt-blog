# The problem with "this" generation

We've all heard it before.  I've no doubt that the oldest and wisest of all our parents and grandparents have begun many a rants with those words.  "The problem with this generation is..."

Heck, most of the time they're right.  One of the things I always take issue with is when it comes to diet an exercise, particularly exercise.  I agree with their assessment of the situation &mdash; people today spend too much time behind the computer/TV and not enough time outdoors.

Yes, that's true.  But, there's also a big problem, which I'll get to.

## Exercising in the past

The thought of going to a gym was nonexistent for my grandparents.  Lifting weights, doing pushups, squatting, and other "exercise" of today's generation was just plain crazy.  They'd never want to do these movements without purpose.

For example, why would one go to a gym and do squats when you've been squatting all day to pick low-hanging butterbeans?  Utter nonsense.

Forget going on power-walks.  They walked everywhere.  When my grandfather was lucky enough to save enough pennies to go see "the pictures", he and a friend would make a 15-mile walk to do so.  Then, he'd make the walk back after the show was over.  The luxury of driving to the movies wasn't even on their mind.  The luxury of owning a car was something only rich folks were accustomed to.

You think folks today complain about mowing the grass?  My grandmother had to hoe the grass in her yard growing up.  That's something to complain about.  Grass was a useless weed not allowed in their yard unless it happened to be in the milk cow's pasture.  By the way, I'm a firm believer that the American love of a nice lawn is one of the major factors of or continued downfall, but that's a subject for another day.

Men and women lifted heavy objects.  Walking a mile from the mill with a couple of 50-lb bags of animal feed was just a part of everyday life.  Moving large stones, helping up an animal that weighed more than one's self, carrying firewood, and all sorts of things were just the way things were.

## From the dawn of humans

What makes humans so vastly different from other animals is our use of technology.  From the first stone tools to the iPad, we've always continued to make life easier in some way.  If I were to define technology, I'd define it as *inventions that make life easier in some way.*

While I love technological advancement and don't know what I do without the Internet, there have been some noticeable drawbacks to each advancement.  Each time we advance, we make things easier.  In the last half century, this has come at a steep price.  For the first time in human history, most of us no longer need to do physical labor to survive.

My grandparents would've died if they hadn't gone outside and worked.  Even if they had a TV or computer, they wouldn't have been able to sit in front of them for hours on end.  Doing so would've meant their death.

Throughout almost all of human history, this has been the case.  If you didn't get out and work to either hunt, gather, or grow your own food, you die.

Humans, like all sentient beings, have pretty strong survival instincts.  Death is a pretty good motivator to get outside and "exercise".

## Exercise today

We no longer have to worry about death by starvation.  As long as you have a few pieces of paper or coins in your pocket, you can live.  There's no need to do any physical labor whatsoever for your food.

While the poor foods of today can certainly be attributed to rising health issues, I'm not so sure that's where the problem is.  The problem lies squarely on how we obtain that food.

When our grandparents' generation says we don't go outside enough and get exercise, that's true.  However, the vast majority of us, even those of us wanting to go outside, have no clue what to do.  Okay, we can rake the yard, mow the grass, and do a few other odds and ends.  But, that doesn't leave us with much work.  We no longer have that drive to do the one thing that's been the driver of pretty much all human advancement, which is to get food.  

We've solved that pesky "get food" problem.  Now, what do we do?


One of the best quotes I've ever heard is, "If children grow kale, children eat kale."
