# The most *awesomesauce* WordPress theme business

I know what you're thinking.  *OMG, not another long, boring list of "influential" people made by a theme author, wagging it while patting some buddies on the back.*

I'm not going to do that. Those lists are not unique, having little more to offer that the guy who wrote the same post last week.

Really.  I wouldn't try to deceive you.

This post is about theme businesses that are *awesomesauce*.  And, I'm going to narrow it down to a list of one.

*So, what is this single theme business that is more awesomesauce than all the other theme businesses?*

## Theme Hybrid

*What makes [Theme Hybrid](http://themehybrid.com) such a badass theme business?*

Because I said so.  Boom!

Really, it's because we have a vibrant community of users and developers, standards-based philosophy, focus on education, and cool shit. Theme Hybrid also happens to be one of the oldest- and longest-running theme businesses around. Also, there's plugins **and** themes; both are 100% $free to download.
