## First financial report

As part of our ongoing promise of full transparency and to give others insights into running a WordPress-related business, Emil and I want to share our initial financial report.  

Currently, we're both working on this part time and have other full-time jobs that we perform.  Eventually, we'd like to turn this into a full-time business for the both of us.  We have some exciting things in the pipeline that will be a natural extension of a review service that focuses on standards and quality.  More on that later.

Without further ado, our current financial report:  As of a few days ago, the business has brought in $8,074.

If you're doing the math, that's roughly $2,000/month.  For part-time work, that's not bad.  However, we want to both be able to make a comfortable living by providing this service within the WordPress ecosystem, so we still have a ways to go.  So far, we're off to a pretty good start.

The best thing you can do to help out with this is spread the word about our service.  We're now reviewing both plugins and themes.
