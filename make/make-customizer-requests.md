# Customizer snippet library: Initial feedback

One of the things we've been discussing is setting up a customizer snippet repository on the <a href="https://github.com/wptrt">TRT GitHub account</a>.  Nothing is exactly set in stone just yet, but we wanted to gather some feedback before moving forward.

* Should this be a library of non-core Controls?
* Should it contain other snippets unrelated to controls?
* How should things be organized?
* What would you like to see?

These are all really broad questions, but it's important to get a feel for what we need to do first if we decide to go ahead with this project.  

We really need to start from square one and decide on exactly what we'd like the repo to be.  From there, we can decide how to organize it.  Then, we can put cool stuff in it.
