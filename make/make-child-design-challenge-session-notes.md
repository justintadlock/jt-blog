# Design Challenge: Child Theme Session Notes

I had a blast talking with everyone during our session today.  I wasn't sure what to expect with an open, Q&A format, but things never got dull for a moment.  I hope I was able to answer everyone's questions.  If not, don't hesitate to ping me on Slack or comment below.

## Notes

Overall, things went great.  Some of the topics we covered:

* What child themes are.
* The benefits of child themes: 1) safe theme upgrades, 2) unique designs.
* Post formats.
* Templates.
* Loading parent and child stylesheets.
* Pluggable functions.
* Theme options.
* Doing child themes the original way by design only (*a la* Sandbox and CSS Zen Garden).

For those who asked, here's the Saga theme <a href="http://justintadlock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/saga-demo-content.zip">demo content</a>. Just unzip and upload the XML file to your development install.

## This Weekend

I want to make sure it's clear: You are free to design anything you want this weekend.  Start a full theme, just make a design, whatever.  My design challenge is just one part of the larger whole.

If you're interested in making a child theme though, I'd love to see it.  I'll personally work with you to get it up on WordPress.org.  Be sure to read the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/12/12/design-challenge-weekend-creating-a-child-theme/">original blog post</a> to make sure you're up to date.

Over the weekend, I and others will be available via #themereview on Slack for answering questions. Feel free to ping <code>@greenshady</code> if you have a question specifically for me.
