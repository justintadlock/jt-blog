# Theme Directory: Tags/Filters: Round 2

Last week, we got some <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/07/27/theme-directory-tagsfilters/">useful feedback</a> on updating the tags/filters for the directory.

Feel free to "+1" or "-1" anything from the following lists.  We need as much feedback as possible.

<h2>Layout Tags</h2>

A "Grid" tag was proposed as an addition.

There seems to be confusion over the existing layout tags:

* Fixed
* Fluid
* Responsive

Theoretically, a theme could have these combinations:

* Fixed
* Fluid
* Fixed + Responsive
* Fluid + Responsive

Maybe we should simplify this.  It's my belief that most users when looking for "fluid" layouts are really just looking for "responsive" layouts.

<h2>Tags up for removal</h2>

* The current color tags.
* "Blavatar" tag.

<h2>Subject Tags</h2>

The main focus was on "subject" tags.  The following is a list that I've broken down into some major categories (we're not worrying about sub-categories right now) based on feedback.  What we need to do is cull this list into something manageable.  There's room for additions as well if needed.  The goal is to balance flexibility and simplicity.

* Animals
* Art
* Blog
* Corporate
* Creative
* e-Commerce
* Education
* Entertainment
* Food
* Gaming
* Holiday
* Hotel
* Magazine
* Music
* Nature
* News
* Outdoors
* Photography
* Photoblogging 
* Portfolio
* Real Estate
* Religious
* Restaurant
* Retail
* Seasonal
* Video

Sorry if I left anything out.  Just let me know in the comments.
