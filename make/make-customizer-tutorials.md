## Customizer tutorials and documentation

One of the things that TRT has been doing over the past several months is striving to make education a top priority.  We've got some awesome things in the pipeline (look out for design and accessibility resources soon).

Today's topic is about utilizing the Customization API (i.e., the theme customizer).  Over the past week I've been gathering links to various tutorials to share with theme authors.  There's actually quite a bit that's been written on the customizer.  I thought it'd be helpful to consolidate some of these into one place.  

This list is just a sampling of what's out there. It also gives us an idea of what hasn't been written about so that we can strive to provide more examples.

<h2>Official Documentation</h2>

Of course, the best place to start is the developer handbook right here on WordPress.org.  So, dive into the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/customizer-api/">Customizer API</a> docs before anything.

<h2>General and Basic Tutorials</h2>

The following tutorials are mostly overviews and general tutorials on the basics of working with the customizer.  A few dive into some more advanced topics, but for the most part, they're good for getting acquainted with the customizer.
