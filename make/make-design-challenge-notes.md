*The Challenge:* Build an awesome child theme in one weekend.

*The Goal:* To help people, particularly designers, learn the basics of creating a simple child theme so that they can become familiar with the WordPress.org theme submission process.  We want better and more variety with the designs on the theme repository.

*The Format:* This is completely open.  Q&A.  You can ask any question about child theming.

*The Parent Theme:* Saga: https://wordpress.org/themes/saga 

*Further Details:* https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/12/12/design-challenge-weekend-creating-a-child-theme/

*Child Theme Challenge Rules:* You're not allowed to create templates in the child theme. Most everything will be handled via `style.css` or `functions.php`.  Getting into templating is another step up.

*After Today:* Over the weekend, we'll critique child themes and make sure they're ready for WordPress.org. If you have a GitHub account, that'd be great because it's easy to keep track of changes, issues, and so on.  Don't worry if you don't.
