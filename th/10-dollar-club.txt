Yep, you read that right.  Currently, Theme Hybrid is opening up its doors for a <a href="http://themehybrid.com/club" title="Theme Hybrid: WordPress theme and plugin club">mere $10 to new users</a>.

I've been told over the years from many people that they'd gladly pay $100 or more for their membership here, which is always nice to hear.  So, why in the world would I slash the membership price to nearly a single digit?  Well, for a couple of reasons.  

The first is that it's been a while since we've had a club promotion around here.  I decided on $10 as a bit of a throwback to the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/15-theme-club-discount">original promotion</a> that helped jump start the theme and plugin club we have today.

The second, and probably more important reason, is that Theme Hybrid is going through some changes.  The site is coming up on its sixth year, and it's time to refocus and expand our offerings.  I'm working day and night to finish a redesign of the site, which will go live at the same time this promotion ends.

These club prices are only going to last about a week.  After that, we'll be switching over to a new pricing/membership system that better accommodates both Theme Hybrid and the different types of members we have here.

<h2>Wait! What? A new membership system?</h2>

It's time.  When I first began this site, all memberships were $25/year.  In 2008, for a kid barely out of college, that seemed like the smart thing to do.  We've only bumped prices once in all that time and have done reasonably well.

Don't worry though.  The new pricing system is still going to be extremely affordable and cheaper than pretty much every other theme/plugin club out there.  We're not trying to keep you from paying the mortgage or feeding your kids. 

I don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of the new system just yet, but I didn't want to throw everyone for a loop when the change takes place.  I'll be writing about it all soon.  

For now, enjoy this special promotion, <a href="http://themehybrid.com/club" title="Theme Hybrid: WordPress theme and plugin club">sign up</a>, and let your friends know about it.

<p class="alert">As an added bonus:  All current club members and anyone who signs up under this $10 offer will automatically be bumped up to a membership worth about 5 times as much when the new system comes into effect.  It might be a good time to sign up.  Just sayin'.</p>
