On Monday this week, I had a chance to introduce you all to my newest parent theme, [Saga](http://themehybrid.com/weblog/saga-wordpress-theme).  As part of the release, I gave designers an opportunity to build [custom child themes](http://themehybrid.com/weblog/revolution-part-2) in exchange for lifetime memberships to the Theme Hybrid community.

Thus far, two themes are ready to go by regulars here:  Sami Keijonen and Thiago Senna.  Since they're both lifetime members here anyway, they're simply releasing their themes out of their love for the WordPress and Theme Hybrid communities.

I love what they've done.  Each design brings its own unique flavor to the Saga theme.  This the best part about making themes like Saga &mdash; I get to help awesome designers showcase their work when they have a limited canvas.  It's fun to see what they do with it.

## Vaaka Theme

[Vaaka](http://themehybrid.com/themes/vaaka) is [Sami Keijonen's](https://foxnet-themes.fi/) child theme contribution.  I'm not sure what his design intent was, but the theme has almost a business feel to it.  I think it'd be great for business or tech bloggers.  The colors and fonts used are much different from the original design, offering a cleaner, crisper feel.

## Sahagin

[Thiago Senna](http://thremes.com.br) designed the [Sahagin](http://themehybrid.com/themes/sahagin) child theme.  He went a completely different route with his design.  For the wandering traveler, this would make for a great theme to document your adventures.  It'd also work well for the blogger who wants more of a typewriter + notepad design for their blog.
