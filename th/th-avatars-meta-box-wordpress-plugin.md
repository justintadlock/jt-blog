While working on the next version of the [Custom Content Portfolio](http://themehybrid.com/plugins/custom-content-portfolio) plugin, I had an idea about making the portfolio project author selectable by avatar instead of the standard author drop-down box.  Then, I thought it'd be better to extend that to any post type rather than just the one I was working with.

Thus, the Avatars Meta Box plugin was born.

## What does the plugin do?

It replaces the standard "Author" meta box on the edit post screen with a new one.  Instead of selecting your post author via a drop-down select, you can click on their avatar.  The author name will appear in the meta box header as "Author: Author Name".

That's pretty much it.  It's a simple plugin that people who are more visually inclined might find useful.

I should also note that this works even better with WordPress 4.4 (currently in beta).  This is because 4.4 introduces a new parameter for user queries that makes getting the correct list of allowed post authors much easier.

## Get the plugin

You can grab the plugin via it's [plugin page](http://themehybrid.com/plugins/avatars-meta-box), it's [WordPress.org page](http://wordpress.org/plugins/avatars-meta-box), or install it directly from your WordPress admin.

I hope you enjoy.
