# Introducing the Unique theme...again

9/16/2013 6:01:19 PM 

As many of you know, I created the [Unique theme](http://themehybrid.com/unique) WordPress theme as part of [an experiment](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2012/09/17/themeforest-an-experiment "ThemeForest: An Experiment") one year ago.  It was the only commercial theme I've had on this site since the early days.

Now that the [experiment is over](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/09/11/the-themeforest-experiment-one-year-later "The ThemeForest Experiment: One Year Later"), I wanted to give back to the Theme Hybrid and WordPress communities.  So, I've now made Unique a free theme for download on the WordPress.org theme repository.

## About the theme

Unique is a WordPress for magazine-style Web sites.  I may have went a little overboard with some of its features, but I wanted to try out some different ideas that I think turned out fairly well.

The following is a list of features that are *unique* to the Unique theme.

* Custom magazine front page template.  This template uses no settings page.  It loads sticky posts and various post formats to display your content.
* Speaking of a theme settings page, this theme doesn't have one.  How many magazine themes can claim that feat?
* Most commented posts widget.
* User profile widget.
* Gallery (post format) widget.
* Image (post format) widget.
* The first WordPress theme to support my new [Whistles plugin](http://themehybrid.com/plugins/whistles), which allows you to build tabs, toggles, and accordions.

These are just features in addition to the normal level of features you get with any theme from Theme Hybrid.

## Download the theme.

You can grab a copy of the theme and see the demo from the [Unique theme](http://themehybrid.com/themes/unique "Unique WordPress Theme") page or get the theme from the WordPress.org [theme repository](http://wordpress.org/themes/unique).
