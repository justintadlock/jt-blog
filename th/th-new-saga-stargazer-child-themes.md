# New Saga and Stargazer child themes

[Stargazer](http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer) is currently our most popular theme at Theme Hybrid, which is not unusual considering the awesome features it has and the number of child themes that have already been built for it.  It's your standard blog theme that's extremely flexible, so it can be used in a wide number of scenarios.

However, [Saga](http://themehybrid.com/themes/saga) has been getting a lot of love lately.  For the blogger who wants to get rid of all the cruft and just get down to writing, it has exactly what you need.  Saga is mainly geared toward long-form content, but it beautifully handles quick posts too.

I'm happy to announce new child themes for both of these parent themes today.  There's a little something for you no matter which parent theme you prefer.

## Ugallu

Ugallu was created to be a fun child theme for Stargazer.  It's definitely a different take on child theme design than what we've seen from Stargazer child themes.  It's beautiful gradients flow well into the overall color scheme.  

This child theme was created by Thiago Senna of [Thremes](http://thremes.com.br/).  This is his 5th child theme, which makes him the theme author with the most themes here at Theme Hybrid other than myself.  And, he's only getting better.

Yarn is another awesome child theme for Saga.  Like it's parent theme, it is specifically tailored to writers, focusing on the display of the written word, using big, bold images to draw your reader in. It has a beautiful pink and brown color palette.

While he's been a longtime member of Theme Hybrid, this child theme is [Kris Hocker's](http://www.krishocker.com) first theme he's made for our community.  I'm glad to have him join the ranks of the other theme authors here.
