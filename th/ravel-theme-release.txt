Today, I'm happy to announce the newest theme to the Theme Hybrid family:  Ravel.  

Typically, I'd go about giving you a whole lot of boring details about why this theme is the <em>awesomesauce</em> when all you really want to do is download it and play around.  Well, I'm still going to make you read a bunch of stuff, but this should be a bit more fun.  I decided to give you a little insight into the design and development process that made this theme possible.

<p>Wait.  I need to know a few things first.  Like, what inspired you to create this design?  Any meaning behind the name 'Ravel'?  Let's get down to the deep stuff here.  Open up your soul and let that artistic energy flow.</p>

In all seriousness, it's been fun working on something with my longtime friend, Tung Do, once again.  I'm only partially paraphrasing our conversation together and teasing Tung a bit.

<h2>Introducing the Ravel theme</h2>

<a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/ravel" title="Ravel WordPress theme"><img src="http://themehybrid.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ravel-portfolio-medium.jpg" alt="ravel-portfolio-medium" width="350" height="402" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2408" /></a>

Ravel was built as a blog, portfolio, and professional profile theme.  The idea was to create a unique design that you'd typically only find on a site created for client rather than just putting out yet another black-and-white theme for the masses. 

Ravel includes some of the usual theme features normally associated with Theme Hybrid themes.  It also has some newer stuff that we've been doing like social network integration into nav menus and Schema.org microdata.  We even included a tabs widget and a custom page template geared toward putting together a professional profile/introduction on your front page.

Like some of our other themes, Ravel includes full integration with the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/custom-content-portfolio">Custom Content Portfolio</a> plugin, which allows you to manage your portfolio of design, photography, and other artwork.

Go check out the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/ravel">Ravel theme page</a> now to download the theme and find out more about its features.  You can also view the <a href="http://locallylost.com/ravel">live demo</a>.
