# Permission to use my plugin names

A few days ago, WordPress.org posted a new [guideline for naming plugins](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/10/05/guidelines-for-plugins-that-include-company-andor-product-names-in-the-plugin-name/) that contain an existing company, trademark, or product name.  I believe this is a great guideline to have to avoid any trademark issues.

To shorten up that article, let's assume you were building an add-on plugin for [Members](http://themehybrid.com/plugins/members) called "Super".  Under the new guideline, you wouldn't be able to name your plugin "Members - Super".  You'd have to name it "Super For Members".

## The user's perspective

<img src="http://themehybrid.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/th-plugins.png" alt="Plugins specific to Theme Hybrid" width="1146" height="491" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6939" />

From a user's perspective, this makes managing groups of plugins a little tougher.  When managing plugins, it's far easier to see a list that's something like the above screenshot.

On Theme Hybrid, I have several plugins that are specifically written for this site, so I name them that way.  Likewise, if I were managing a site with multiple Members add-ons, I'd like to see them listed like so:

* Members
* Members - Super
* Members - Duper
* Members - Some Cool Stuff

WordPress has no built-in way of *categorizing* plugins.  Until such a system is put into place, using the plugin name as a pseudo-category is the closest we can get.

Maybe if we get enough Members add-ons, I might even make something like that for users' plugins screens.

## Permission

If you're a plugin developer who is building an add-on for one of my plugins, I'm entirely open to allowing you to use a plugin name like "Members - Super".  Feel free to shoot me an email for written permission if you want to go that route.
