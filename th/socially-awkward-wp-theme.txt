One type of theme I've always wanted to build is a video theme.  It's also been requested on many occasions in the past.  I'm here today to tell you that I have not built a video theme.

Honestly, when I first started working on the Socially Awkward theme, I had planned to create a video theme because WordPress 3.6 just dropped some awesomeness on us with video support.  However, I decided to truly do a video theme justice (like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.), it would need an accompanying plugin to handle a lot of extra non-theme features.  That's just not what I wanted to do.  I wanted to focus on designing a theme rather than developing features.

So, instead, I built a theme that highlights all sorts of media, not just videos.

<h2>About the theme</h2>

Socially Awkward is a theme that I believe the average WordPress user needs.  It's about getting back to the roots of <em>web</em>logging and sharing content.

I don't want to sound like I'm over-hyping it too much, but this is a project I've fallen in love with.  It's the first time in a while I've pushed through 16-hour days just so I could play around with a new idea.  It's been invigorating and has rejuvenated my love for simply designing WordPress themes.

The plan for this theme was simple:  use WordPress' post formats, Hybrid Core's new media grabber, and media from around the Web.  Then, mix them all together and see what happens.

I believe I've created a theme that performs its job well.

<h2>What's different about this theme?</h2>

Socially Awkward has some new features that I've been experimenting with lately but have finally gotten a chance to fully put to use.  Here's a list of a few things that's different about this theme.

<ul>
	<li>It's one of the few themes in existence that takes advantage of WordPress' new features for self-hosted audio and video like a custom-skinned media player and the display of ID3 tags (i.e., audio/video metadata).</li>
	<li>Takes advantage of the Hybrid Core framework's new media grabber (added in 1.6) to pull media from a post, which is something you'll probably see from more Hybrid-built themes in the future.</li>
	<li>Uses WordPress' nav menu system to handle the display of your social networking profiles.</li>
	<li>No theme options.  Yes, that's a feature.  Themes should just work, and I've done my best to make theme setup as worry-free as possible.</li>
	<li>Post formats navigation.  There's an included "formats" menu.  But, the cool feature is that navigation between single posts is to the next/previous post by format (e.g., the next video, previous quote, etc.).</li>
	<li>We've got Bon Iver in <a href="http://locallylost.com/socially-awkward/2013/08/02/skinny-love/">the demo</a>.  What other themes can claim that?</li>
</ul>
