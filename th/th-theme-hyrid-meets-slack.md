One of our newest members, @shivanand, was kind enough to start us up a [Slack community](https://hybridwp.slack.com/) here and hand over the keys to me. This was something I'd given a little thought to, but sometimes I just need someone to nudge me in the right direction.

For those of you unfamiliar with Slack, it's the chat system that WordPress.org has been using for a while now.  It's hands-down the best chat platform I've ever used and is quickly gaining popularity.

We're going to run a bit of an experiment to see how this community likes Slack.  I think it would be useful.  If you're a paid club member, I want to invite you to join us.

You can use this for real-time communication.

## How to join

Just post a comment below.  I'll send you an invite.  Once the invite is sent, you'll get an email with instructions on joining.

Please make sure you're logged into the site before leaving a comment.

## The future

This is an evaluation period to see how our community likes Slack and if it's a good fit for us.

If we decide it's a good fit, we'll eventually move away from Slack's free plan to one of their fully-featured paid services.  That's a bridge we'll cross when we come to it.  In the interest of full disclosure, I wanted you to be aware that if we cross that bridge in the future, I'll need to charge for Slack access.  I imagine it would be an optional membership add-on.

For now, let's see where it goes.
