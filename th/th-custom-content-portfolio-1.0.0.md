When I first released the [Custom Content Portfolio](http://themehybrid.com/plugins/custom-content-portfolio) (CCP) plugin a couple of years ago, it was just a simple plugin that registered a post type and a taxonomy.  It did pretty much what 99% of all other portfolio implementations done.  It didn't bring anything new to the table.

And, to be honest, I haven't seen much else in the way of innovation in the space since then.

Version 1.0.0 of CCP seeks to change all that.

## The new version

I want CCP to be **the** portfolio plugin of choice for everyone.  If you're a theme developer and have any type of portfolio stuff as part of your theme design, do your users a favor and integrate with this plugin.

In this version, I went all out and built a complete portfolio solution that should satisfy anyone's needs.  And, if it doesn't, it's extremely easy to extend for plugin and theme developers.

Here's a list of a few features:

* Should work relatively well with most themes out of the box.
* Custom permalink settings.
* Stick projects to the top of the portfolio page.
* Author archives.
* Categories taxonomy.
* Tags taxonomy.
* Support for audio, gallery, image, and video post formats.
* Project URL field.
* Project client field.
* Project location field.
* Project start and date fields.
* Basic template hierarchy for themes to use.
* Full compliment of template tags for themes.

The plugin also follows the [Content Type Standards](https://github.com/justintadlock/content-type-standards) project, which is created and maintained by various members of the WordPress development community.  This means that you can switch between any portfolio plugins that follow the standards without losing data.
