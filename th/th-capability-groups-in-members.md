# Capability groups for the Members plugin

With the [latest update]() of the Members plugin, we've got some nifty developer features.  I've already written about [role groups](http://themehybrid.com/weblog/role-groups-in-the-members-plugin).  Today's topic is on capability groups.

Forgive me for not being overly creative with the names of the two features.  They're *groups* of roles and *groups* of capabilities.  It doesn't leave a lot of room for creativity.

Capability groups are a method of grouping certain capabilities together.  If you look at the edit/new role screen, there's an "Edit Capabilities" box with several tabs.  Each tab represents a single group of capabilities.

What's cool about this is that plugin developers can create custom groups.
