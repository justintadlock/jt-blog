# Members - Role Levels WordPress Plugin

It's a pretty exciting day around the Theme Hybrid office (actually, the front porch is my office, which isn't really an office at all).  Today is the official launch of my first commercial plugin.

For those of you who have been around for a while, you know I'd never planned on getting into product sales when I first started Theme Hybrid, but the landscape has changed over the years.  I will write more about this in another blog post to explain this decision.

My first paid plugin isn't going to blow you away.  I thought it would be best to start simple with an add-on for my popular [Members plugin](http://themehybrid.com/plugins/members) (more add-ons to come).  That way, I wouldn't put too much on my plate getting the site ready and launching a massive plugin at the same time.

So, without further ado, let me present to you the start of a new era.

## Introducing Members - Role Levels

<a href="http://themehybrid.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2.png"><img src="http://themehybrid.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-2.png" alt="Select role level" width="1177" height="591" class="size-full wp-image-7115" /></a>

The [Members - Role Levels](http://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-levels) plugin exposes the old user levels system in WordPress.

User levels were actually deprecated ages ago in WordPress, so it seems kind of crazy to create a plugin for them.  However, the WordPress post author drop-down relies on this.  There's a longstanding WordPress bug where users that don't have "level 1" won't show up in the post author drop-down box, even if they have permission to be the post author.  This only happens for custom roles without levels.

This plugin fixes that issue.  It also allows you to use levels in the off-chance that some other plugin is still relying on them instead of roles and capabilities.

That's pretty much all the plugin does.  You select a level for a role.  It gets applied to all the users of that role.  Your author drop-downs will work.

Like I said, I wanted to start with a simple plugin that would be useful for a good many people.

## Licenses? Updates? Other stuff?

Like all my WordPress plugins, this one is licensed under the GPL version 2 or later.  You're free to copy, modify, and/or distribute the code as long as you follow the license.  Nothing is changing in this regard.

There are also no single-site, multi-site, developer, or whatever licenses.  You pay for it once and get support for it regardless of the number of sites you want to use it on.

For this particular plugin, it's a lifetime (lifetime of the plugin or lifetime of this site) purchase.  You don't have to pay for updates in the future.  You'll get them free of charge.

## How to purchase

The plugin is available for $10.00 USD.  You can grab a copy from the [Members - Role Levels](http://themehybrid.com/plugins/members-role-levels) plugin page.  Simply click on the purchase button to make it through the checkout process.
