# Revolution: Part #2

This past November, I [released the first version](http://themehybrid.com/weblog/revolution-in-theme-design) of the Stargazer WordPress theme to people who were interested in building child themes.  I didn't give them a lot to go on at first.  The idea was that they could build a child theme quickly, possibly in less than an hour.

This proved to be a resounding success.  We got many child theme submissions, and [Stargazer](http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer) is now our most popular theme.

Stargazer was only phase one in a shift of how Theme Hybrid themes are being built.  I further wrote about this philosophy in [Designing the Box](http://themehybrid.com/weblog/designing-the-box), which explains how everything works.

Today, I'm releasing the second theme in this series.

## Introducing Saga: A theme for writers

While Stargazer was a general-purpose blog theme, Saga is a theme built with writers in mind.

One of the reasons I began using WordPress or even blogging at all was because I hoped to one day become a novelist.  Storytelling is a passion of mine.  Of course, my career is currently on a different trajectory, but my love of the written word has not changed.

The goal for this project was to build a theme that I would love to use to share my stories with the world.  I wanted something both I and other writers could feel comfortable working with.  

As I built the theme, I found myself stripping down everything.  If it didn't accentuate the content, I removed it.  I wanted to get down to the essence of what makes a good theme for writers &mdash; the proverbial pen and pad for the Web.  I hope I accomplished just that.

## Join me once again

Last time, we had 50 people sign up.  I had expected only about 1/4 of that, so I was entirely unprepared and ended up wasting a lot of time in how I handled everything from the beginning.  This time, the process should go a lot more smoothly.

Like Stargazer, you can literally build a custom child theme for Saga with just a few lines of code.  So, I'd like for you all to join me once again in making some cool child themes.

If you’re a designer and would like to test this theme, here’s your opportunity. Here's how it works:

* You get detailed instructions on how to build a child theme for Saga.
* The child theme you build will be hosted here on this site and on WordPress.org.
* You’ll get a free, lifetime membership to Theme Hybrid. [Theme submission rules](http://themehybrid.com/about/submit-themes) still apply.

All you need to do is let me know if you're interested in this in the comments below.  You'll receive an email from me within 24 hours.

You can download an early copy of the theme via:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/justintadlock/saga) (do a recursive clone)
* [ZIP](https://wordpress.org/themes/download/saga.1.0.0.zip?nostats=1)
